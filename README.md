# Recommendation_System
The movie recommendation system built using algorithms like KNN, Slope One, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a Github project that offers a highly personalized and accurate movie recommendation system to users.

The project is built using Python programming language and utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of data related to user preferences and movie ratings. KNN algorithm is used to identify similar movies based on user ratings, while Slope One algorithm predicts a user's rating based on other user's ratings. SVD algorithm is used to create a low-dimensional representation of the rating matrix to identify latent features that are common among users.

The project uses various datasets like MovieLens dataset to train the model and test its performance. The model is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness.

Users can interact with the movie recommendation system through a simple web interface that recommends movies based on their preferences. The project also includes comprehensive documentation and instructions on how to set up and use the system, making it easy for other developers to contribute to and improve the project.
